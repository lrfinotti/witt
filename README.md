# Witt Vectors and Canonical Liftings

This repository will contain various functions to run on
[MAGMA](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) to perform computations
with Witt vectors and canonical liftings.  This is just a first commit
and needs to be cleaned up quite a bit!  Hopefully it will happen
soon-ish.
